GripDeck Controller is an input controller (used in the GripDeck cyberdeck project) leveraging USB HID and Bluetooth Low Energy interfaces implemented via a custom vendor-defined HID protocol and a dedicated Linux daemon. It provides advanced onboard power management including battery sag compensation, discharge/charge estimations, deep-sleep modes and status LEDs for optimized runtime and responsive user feedback.
